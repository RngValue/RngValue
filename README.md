## Hey there, I'm Value.
A 16 year old, who does programming as a hobby... atleast until I'm done with school, which is when it hopefully becomes my job.

## What's up with me:
I use C# and Python. However, for game development I use Godot and Gamemaker Studio.

Wait, this section is called "What's up with me"? Well... I'm ok, I guess

## My work:
Of course, here's my work: [Itch](https://randomvalue134.itch.io/) and [Gamejolt](https://gamejolt.com/@randomizeit)

Why is it all games? What is the point of making them, if noone's gonna play them? What's the meaning of life?

To all of that I say: idk bro
