## Hey there, I'm RngValue. 
A 17 year old, who does programming as a hobby and hopefully will become my job in the future.

## What tools do I use:
I mostly use vscode, but if I need to make quick changes, I use notepad++.

I mainly use C#, Javascript and Python, but am also familiar with C++ and ruby.
For game development I use Godot and Gamemaker Studio.
